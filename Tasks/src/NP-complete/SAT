Boolean satisfiability problem

Boolean satisfiability problem is NP-complete


2-SAT is a special case of Boolean Satisfiability Problem and can be solved
in polynomial time.

CNF : CNF is a conjunction (AND) of clauses, where every clause is a disjunction (OR).

Now, 2-SAT limits the problem of SAT to only those Boolean formula which are expressed as a CNF with every clause
having only 2 terms(also called 2-CNF).

Example: F = (A1 or B1) and (A2 or B2) and (A3 or B3) and ....... and (Am or Bm)

Thus, Problem of 2-Satisfiabilty can be stated as:

Given CNF with each clause having only 2 terms, is it possible to assign such values to the variables so that the CNF is TRUE?

Input : F = (x1 or x2) and (x2 or not x1) and (not x1 ir not x2)
Output : The given expression is satisfiable.
         (for x1 = FALSE, x2 = TRUE)

Input : F = (x1 or x2) and (x2 or not x1) and (x1 or not x2) and (not x1 or not x2})
Output : The given expression is unsatisfiable.
         (for all possible combinations of x1 and x2)

(x or y) and not x

Is it possible to make this expression true ?
