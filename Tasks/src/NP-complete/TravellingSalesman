Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP):

Given a set of cities and distance between every pair of cities, the problem is to find the shortest possible
route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Note the difference between Hamiltonian Cycle and TSP. The Hamiltoninan cycle problem is to find if there exist a tour
that visits every city exactly once. Here we know that Hamiltonian Tour exists (because the graph is complete) and in
fact many such tours exist, the problem is to find a minimum weight Hamiltonian Cycle.

The problem is a famous NP hard problem. There is no polynomial time know solution for this problem.
